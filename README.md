# wordCounter

//This program prompts the user for the word to search for and the file path of the text file to search in. It then opens the file for reading and counts the number of occurrences of the word in the file. It uses a while loop to read each word in the file and compares it to the search word, ignoring case. It then prints the total number of occurrences of the word in the file to the console.
